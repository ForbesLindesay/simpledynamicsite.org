      <h1>Simple Dynamic Site</h1>
      <p>
        This guide currently assumes you have installed a recent version of node.js.  You can run your app for free, but
        it will only be accessible for 18 hours per day.  This is intended so you can try things out.  You can upgrade
        to the full 24 hour version for $7 per month (at time of writing).  I'm not getting sponsored by Heroku for this.
      </p>
      <h2>Step 1: Choose a domain name</h2>
      <p>
        You need to register your chosen domain name. I recommend <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/?aff=99746">namecheap</a>
        for this.  They're both one of the cheapest, and have good security set up, which is very important for your domain
        registrar.  Simply go to <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/?aff=99746">www.namecheap.com</a>, enter your domain
        and click search, then follow the instructions to pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recommend you pay the extra for "WhoisGuard" as without it you'll get a lot of spam.  If you don't have
        WhoisGuard, your contact details will be publicly available to anyone who wants to know who owns the domain.
      </p>
      <h2>Step 2: Setup Cloudflare</h2>
      <p>
        This step <strong>can</strong> take a few days to fully complete, so you should start this as soon as you have
        registered your website.  Sign up for a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">cloudflare account</a>.  Add your
        newly registered domain to cloudflare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once cloudflare tells you to set your nameservers, you can go to your <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/?aff=99746">namecheap dashboard</a>
        and click "Domain List" then "Manage" on your chosen domain.  From here, Choose "Custom DNS" under "NAMESERVERS",
        then enter the two nameservers cloudflare tells you to.  I recommend refreshing the page to make sure the change
        has been saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        It typically takes about 30 minutes for cloudflare to recognise your change.  In the mean time, you can start
        building your website.
      </p>
      <h2>Step 3: Create your website</h2>
      <p>
        Sign up for an account on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and create a new repository.  Use the domain
        name you have chosen as the name of the repository.  If you don't already have it, install the <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github Desktop</a> app.
        You can then use the app to "clone" your new repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open the resulting folder, using your text editor of choice (I recommend <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Add a <code>.gitignore</code> that has the following contents:
      </p>
      <pre><code><file path="example/.gitignore"/></code></pre>
      <p>
        Add a package.json that has the following contents:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-json"><file path="example/package.json"/></code></pre>
      <p>Then run <code>npm install</code> to install dependencies.</p>
      <p>
        Add a sever.js file containing:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js"><file path="example/server.js"/></code></pre>
      <p>
        Add an index.html file with whatever content you want in it, e.g.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-html"><file path="example/index.html"/></code></pre>
      <p>
        Check that it works by running <code>node server</code> and navigating
        to <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>.
        Now commit and push that code.
      </p>
      <h2>Step 4: Set up Heroku</h2>
      <p>
        Sign up for an account on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.  Create a
        <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/new">new app</a>.  Your app name can be any string of letters, hyphens and
        numbers.  Note that you should update the <code>heroku-release --app example-app-name</code> command in your
        package.json file with your chosen app name.
      </p>
      <h2>Step 5: Publishing to Heroku on Commit</h2>
      <p>
        Go to <a href="https://travis-ci.org/profile/">Travis CI</a> and enable it for your repository. Then click settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a new tab, go to your <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/account">account page on heroku</a> and copy your
        API Key.  <strong>Making sure that "Display value in build log" is set to "Off",</strong> add that API Key to
        Environment Variables with a Name of "HEROKU_API_TOKEN".
      </p>
      <p>
        Back in the repository, add a .travis.yml file containing:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-yaml"><file path="example/.travis.yml"/></code></pre>
      <p>
        Commit and push this new file and your site should get built
        and uploaded by travis.  You should now be able to see your site at
        <a href="https://example-app-name.herokuapp.com">example-app-name.herokuapp.com</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Step 6: Set up cloudflare</h2>
      <p>
        Now that you have the site hosted on Heroku, all that remains is to fix
        the URL so it is nice and memorable, and add support for https.
      </p>
      <p>
        In cloudflare, edit the DNS records.  First, remove any existing "A" or "CNAME" records, then add two new "CNAME" records:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>@</code> to <code>example-app-name.herokuapp.com</code></li>
        <li><code>www</code> to <code>example-app-name.herokuapp.com</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ensure cloudflare is enabled for both records</p>
      <p>Go to "Page Rules" within cloudflare and add two new rules</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To make visitors use https, pattern <code>http://*example.com/*</code>, then enable "Always use https"</li>
        <li>To redirect from www.example.com to example.com, Pattern <code>www.example.com/*</code>, then redirect to <code>https://example.com/$1</code></li>
        <li>Or to redirect from example.com to www.example.com, pattern <code>example.com/*</code>, then redirect to <code>https://www.example.com/$1</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once those changes have propagated, you should be able to see your
        website by navigating to <a href="https://example.com/">https://example.com/</a>.  It should also auto
        update every time you push new changes to GitHub.
